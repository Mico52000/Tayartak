A flight ticket react app 

Michael George 46-1728 :
1.The system should allow the Administrator  to search through all existing flights using search criteria including flight number, departure and arrival times, dates and airport terminals.
2.The system should show the Administrator a list of all the available flights without any search criteria.
3.Designed the UI Components which we all used 

Nerimane Mohamed 46-3346 :
1.The system should allow the Administrator to delete any selected flights and all their details upon confirmation.
2.The system should promt the Administrator if they are sure they want to delete the flight and all its details (to confirm the deletion).
3.The system should update the flight schedule should any changes be made by the Administrator to any of the flights.

Mohamed Sherif 46-12029 :
1.The system should have an already existing user called Administrator.
2.The system should allow the Administrator to create flights including all flight details such as flight number, departure and arrival times, dates, number of Economy seats, number of Business class seats, and airport.

2.The system should update the flight schedule should any changes be made by the Administrator to any of the flights.

-The schema was designed by all of us , to be updated or edited as we go along the project.
-The database was edited to make it more user friendly , instead of having 3 documents for the same flight but different class seats , 
 3 columns were added for each class to have 1 document per flight.Also a column for flight number was added to make the CRUD operations more realistic.
